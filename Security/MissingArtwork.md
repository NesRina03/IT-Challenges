### OSINT Challenge -The Missing Artwork-

#### Methodology 
The challenge was fairly easy, since I already recognised the artwork as Van Gogh's *Starry Night*, all I had to do was look up its current location. But if that wasn't the case, then a step would be added to the process which is looking up the picture using **Google Lens** for example, get its name then do the rest.
